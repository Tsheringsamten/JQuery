    <h1>Web development</h1>
    <h3 id="reed">Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</h3>
        <p id="www">For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>

        <h3>What is web development?</h3>
        <p id="mmm">A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is visually appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website’s performance and capacity. </p>

        <h3>How much do web developers make?</h3>
        <p id="nnn">The median annual salary for web developers in the US is $78,300, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) . However, web developers in the US can earn up to $249,297 according to Glassdoor salary insights . How much you earn will depend on many factors, including where you work, what industry you work in, and how much experience you have.

            BLS estimates 23 percent industry growth for web developers between 2021-2031, a faster-than-average rate compared to other occupations. One of the driving forces behind this increase in web development jobs is the growth of e-commerce. Companies are becoming more reliant on functioning websites that operate on multiple devices to do business.</p>

        <h3>Types of web developers</h3>
        <h2>Double Click to HIDE a Text</h2>
            <p>1. Back-end web developers create the website’s structure, write code, and verify the code works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who need to manage a website’s content.</p>
            <p>2. Front-end web developers work on the visual part of the website—the pages visitors see and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design the physical layout of each page, integrate graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site. You can gain essential front-end web development skills with Meta's Front-End Developer Professional Certificate.</p>
            <p>3. Full-stack developers do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer. These developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team. If you're interested in full-stack web development, consider earning IBM's Full-Stack Developer Professional Certificate.</p>
            <p>4. Webmasters are essentially website managers. Their primary responsibility is to keep the website updated, ensuring that the links and applications on each page work properly.</p>

        <h2>5 Interesting Facts About Web Application Development A Website Owner Must Know</h2>
        <button id="stop">STOP!</button>
     <div id="scarlet">
        <h2>CHECK!</h2>
     </div>
     <div id="violet">1. A Website Doesn’t Look Same on Diverse Computer Screens
        Browsers on each device render a website in a different manner. It is this reason, a website that looks a certain way on Google Chrome in desktop computer looks different on Safari in your iPhone.
        
        How a website will look on the screen depends on factors such as parsing and rendering, means how a browser translate the code in a website and display it on your screen.
        
        2. Most of the Readers Simply Scan the Website
        In research on how people read websites, Nielsen Norman Group found that 79% of test users scanned the website, and only 16% of users read the text word by word.
        
        This means a website must have scannable text, including keywords, sub-headings, bulleted lists, only one idea in a paragraph, and fewer words to enable readers to run through the content.
        
        If a copy is not properly formatted for skimming and scanning, website visitors might lose their interest and skip to the next option in the search result. Good quality graphics, outbound hypertext links, and good writing together forms a great copy.
        
        So if you do not have your own team of copywriters, check with your web development company if they offer such services or you might take help from the external vendors.
        
        3. Two Third of Web Usage is on Mobile Devices
        The rise of smartphones has changed the medium through which users reach out to a website.
        
        Most of the users browse the Internet on smartphones. and so make sure your web application development company must optimize the website to deliver a delightful mobile experience.
        
        4. Life Span of Website is Just 3 Years
        Digital space is continually evolving. From hardware to software, every aspect of the Internet is bound to change in a few years, and its result affects the websites too.
        
        So, a website designed three years back must be upgraded to the latest technology available to provide the optimum level of user experience.
        
        In the current scenario, emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, IoT, and Blockchain have begun impacting websites.
        
        Top companies have already powered their website with new-age technologies to adopt a data-driven approach and get visibility into the system.
        
        5. Source Code of Website Affects Search Engine Ranking
        Search engines read the source code of your website, and so it is essential that web developers make the code SEO friendly.
        
        Search engines like Google pick up the ranking signals from different HTML elements.
        
        Web developing during the application development process must focus on elements such as HTML title tag, meta description tag, header tags, and structured data tag.
